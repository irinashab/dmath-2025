<h2 id="warm-up">Warm up</h2>

<p>Let \(X = \{ a, b, c, d \}\). How many subsets of \(X\) are there? List out as many as you can. How many subsets of  \(X\) of each size are there? (That is, how many have size 4, size 3, etc)?</p>

<p>What is the connection between this and the counting principles we studied earlier?</p>

<h2 id="ordered-pairs-and-tuples">Ordered Pairs and Tuples</h2>
<p>The two sets <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> are considered equal, because sets are determined entirely by the elements, and not their orders. So we need a new kind of object that does distinguish between orders: this is the notion of the ordered pair, or, more generally, an ordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple. There is a set-theoretic definition of ordered pair, but it’s not super important: all that matters is that <span class="math inline">\((0, 1) \neq (1, 0)\)</span> as ordered pairs. Our notation here is important: the parentheses represent ordered pairs, while the curly braces represent sets. More generally, we can think about ordered triples, like <span class="math inline">\((0, 1, 0)\)</span>, or ordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples, like <span class="math inline">\((a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)\)</span>.<br />
Give two sets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, the <strong>Cartesian product</strong> <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span> is the set of all ordered pairs of the form <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are both the set of real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, the set is the normal Cartesian plane. In general, we refer to <span class="math inline">\(A \times A\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(A^2\)</span>.<br />
Lastly, one more definition which we will refer to again later: a relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> between sets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is any subset of <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are both the set of integers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, one relation we might consider is the set <span class="math inline">\(\{ (x, y) : x \leq y \}\)</span>. This is the “order”-relation on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>By now, you have quite a bit of experience with functions, mostly functions of real numbers. Usually, you may have heard of a function as a “rule” of some sort associating some input with some output. We will provide a more formal definition here:<br />
<strong>Definition:</strong> Given two sets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, a function <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span>, read as “ is a function from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>”, is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span> such that for each <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>, there is exactly one <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\((a, b) \in f\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is referred to as the <strong>domain</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is referred to as the <strong>codomain</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.<br />
This definition is meant to formalize the “vertical line test”: a graph on the plane depicts a function if no <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-value has more than one corresponding <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-value. So, for example, the following graph depicts one function, and one relation which is not a function.</p>
<div class="desmos-container"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kraboqmkrb?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe></div>
<p>Normally, we write <span class="math inline">\(f(a) = b\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\((a, b) \in f\)</span>: that is, we use functional notation rather than “set theoretic notation”. Some more vocabulary / notation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recall that the <strong>domain</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the set of all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-values such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is defined.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>codomain</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> constrains where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can take its outputs from.</p></li>
<li><p>The domain and codomain are part of the <em>definition</em> of the function itself. For example, I cannot say <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x\)</span> is a function. I need to say what the domain and codomain of is. The function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=n\)</span> is a <strong>different function</strong> from <span class="math inline">\(g: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(g(n)=n\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>, we refer to <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> as the image of the point <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(X \subseteq A\)</span>, the set <span class="math inline">\(f(X) = \{ f(a) : a \in X \}\)</span> is referred to as the <strong>image</strong> of the set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(A)\)</span> is called the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Our definition of a function is a set of ordered pairs with a particular property. So let’s look at some examples of sets of ordered pairs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As a subset of <span class="math inline">\(\{ 0, 1 \} \times \{ a, b, c \}\)</span>:<span class="math inline">\(\{ (0, a), (0, b), (1, c) \}\)</span> is <strong>not</strong> a function because there is no single output for <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>As a subset of <span class="math inline">\(\{ 0, 1 \} \times \{ a, b, c \}\)</span> :<span class="math inline">\(\{ (0, a) \}\)</span> is <strong>not</strong> a function because there is no output for <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>As a subset of <span class="math inline">\(\{ 0 \} \times \{ a, b, c \}\)</span>:<span class="math inline">\(\{ (0, a) \}\)</span> <strong>is</strong> a function!. This is <strong>the</strong> function <span class="math inline">\(f : \{ 0 \} \to \{ a, b, c \}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(0)=a\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How many functions are there from <span class="math inline">\(\{ 0 \} \to \{ a, b, c \}\)</span>? How many from <span class="math inline">\(\{ 0, 1 \}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\to \{ a, b, c \}\)</span>?</p>
<h2 id="injections-one-to-one">Injections: One to One</h2>
<p>Function <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> s called <strong>one to one</strong>, or an <strong>injection</strong> (as an adjective, <strong>injective</strong>), if whenever <span class="math inline">\(a \neq b \in X\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(a) \neq f(b)\)</span>. Let’s look at a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span>. This is not one to one, because <span class="math inline">\(f(1)=f(-1)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s again think of the function <span class="math inline">\(g(x)=x^2\)</span>, but this time let’s let <span class="math inline">\(g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is one to one: among natural numbers, if <span class="math inline">\(n \neq m\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(n^2 \neq m^2\)</span>. (Can you prove this?)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="surjections-onto">Surjections: Onto</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> s called <strong>onto</strong>, or a <strong>surjection</strong> (as an adjective, <strong>surjective</strong>), if whenever <span class="math inline">\(y \in Y\)</span>, there is at least one <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=y\)</span>. Another way to think of this: a <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is equal to the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span>. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=n\)</span> is onto.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(g(n)=n\)</span> is not onto, since there is no <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=-1.\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be the set of perfect squares. Them <span class="math inline">\(h : \mathbb{Z} \to S\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(h(n) = n^2\)</span> is an onto function that is not one to one. It’s onto because given a perfect square <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, there is an integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(n^2=s\)</span>. This is the definition of a perfect square: <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s}\)</span> is an integer! It’s not one to one because <span class="math inline">\(1^2=(-1)^2\)</span>.<br />
Let’s keep in mind the previous paragraph in terms of how to argue that a function is or isn’t onto, and is or isn’t one to one. To show that it wasn’t one to one, I showed a counterexample: two numbers that were mapped to the same number. To show that a function is one to one, you have to prove, for any, arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, if they are not equal, then <span class="math inline">\(f(n) \neq f(m)\)</span> (You could show the contrapositive: start with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(m)=f(n)\)</span>, and conclude that <span class="math inline">\(m=n\)</span>.)<br />
Similarly, to show that a function is not onto, you show a counterexample: a single <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in the codomain that is not the image of any point. To show that a function is onto, you have to show that given an arbitrarily chosen <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in the codomain, you can find an <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the domain where <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=y\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="bijections-both">Bijections: Both</h2>
<p>A function that is both one to one and onto is called a bijection. A bijection is sometimes called a one to one correspondence. Let’s look at some examples:<br />
Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the set of all strings (“words”) of length 3 that can be made with the letters <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}a\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> the set of all strings of length 3 that can be made with the numbers <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>. We will refer to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as the set of all “<strong>binary strings of length 3</strong>”. These sets can be put into a one to one correspondence by turning a’s into 0s, and b’s into 1s:</p>
<p>aaa<br />
aab<br />
aba<br />
abb<br />
baa<br />
bab<br />
bba<br />
bbb</p>
<p>Another way to think about a bijection between two sets is to see if there is a way of “labeling” objects from one set using objects from another set. As an example, let’s think of the set of those strings of length 3 that can be made with the numbers <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Later on we will learn about binary numbers: every natural number can be represented in binary (instead of the usual decimal system). We only need three binary digits (also called <strong>bits</strong>) to represents the numbers <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. So we have a bijection, by labeling each binary string by the number that it represents: <span class="math inline">\(g : \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \} \to B\)</span> would be given by:</p>
<p>g(0) &amp;= 000<br />
g(1) &amp;= 001<br />
g(2) &amp;= 010<br />
g(3) &amp;= 011<br />
g(4) &amp;= 100<br />
g(5) &amp;= 101<br />
g(6) &amp;= 110<br />
g(7) &amp;= 111</p>
<p>We will study how to convert from a number to its binary representation later this semester.</p>
<h2 id="example-power-sets-binary-strings">Example: Power Sets / Binary Strings</h2>
<p>There is an interesting bijection between power sets and binary strings. Let’s stick with sets of 3 objects and strings of length 3. Let’s look at the set <span class="math inline">\(A=\{a,b,c\}\)</span>. In a sense, we can think of binary strings of length 3 as describing subsets of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Let’s think of it this way: a single 0 or 1 in a particular position will represent the answer to a “yes” or “no” question (with 1 representing “yes”, 0 representing “no”). So: what, exactly is the question? That is, what are the 3 yes/no questions we need to ask in order to describe a subset of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>?<br />
We need to know 3 bits of information to describe a subset <span class="math inline">\(X \subseteq A\)</span>: is <span class="math inline">\(a \in X\)</span>? Is <span class="math inline">\(b \in X\)</span>? And is <span class="math inline">\(c \in X\)</span>? So, for example, the string <span class="math inline">\(011\)</span> might represent the set <span class="math inline">\(/{b,c}\)</span> since the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> represents a “no” for the first question, the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> represents a “yes” to the second question, and the last <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> represents a “yes” to the third question.<br />
This is quite an informal description of a function, but we can write it down explicitly since there are only <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> possible binary strings of length 3:</p>
<p>000 &amp;<br />
001 &amp;{ c }<br />
010 &amp;{ b }<br />
011 &amp;{b, c }<br />
100 &amp;{a }<br />
101 &amp;{a, c }<br />
110 &amp;{a, b }<br />
111 &amp;{a, b, c }</p>
<p>Here we are using the fact that we enumerated all 8 binary strings of length three previously. Why is this a bijection? We need to show that this function is one to one and onto. First: it’s one to one, because when we look at the outputs, they are all different!<br />
So why is it “onto”? Take a set <span class="math inline">\(X \subseteq A\)</span>. We know that, since it’s a subset of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we can ask if <span class="math inline">\(a \in X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\in X\)</span>, and if <span class="math inline">\(c \in X\)</span>. Each of these questions would give us a yes/no, or a 1/0 response. Put those together and we get the corresponding binary string. That is, we can invert this function!</p>
<h2 id="non-examples">Non-examples</h2>
<p>There is no bijection from the set <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> to the set <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span>. Why not? Let’s look at all possible functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are three functions from <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> which map <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.One of these maps <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, one maps <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and one maps <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. In the first two cases, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is not in the image, and in the last case, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is not in the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, there are three functions from <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> which map <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and three which map <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Each one of these will leave something out of the image.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So when is there a bijection between two sets? It’s a fairly simple characterization: the two sets need to have the same size!<br />
<strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be finite sets. There is a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> have the same number of elements in them.<br />
<strong>Proof:</strong><br />
This is an “if and only if” statement, which means we have to prove two implications. If there is a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> have the same number of elements. And if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> have the same number of elements, then there is a bijection between the two sets.<br />
I will leave the first implication to you on the next problem set. What do you need to prove here? You assume that <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span> is a bijection, which means it’s one to one and onto. You then need to show that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> have the same number of elements. So start by assuming that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct elements, and let <span class="math inline">\(a_1, \ldots, a_n\)</span> enumerate those elements (so they are all different). You must conclude that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> also has exactly <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements, somehow.<br />
For now, though, let’s prove the second implication: that if two sets have the same number of elements, then there is a bijection between them. Let’s suppose that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> both have size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, for some <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span>. We can enumerate the elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(a_1, \ldots, a_n\)</span>, and the elements of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(b_1, \ldots, b_n\)</span>. Then the function <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span> which is defined by <span class="math inline">\(a_i \mapsto b_i\)</span> is a bijection!<br />
This is fairly simple to see, but there are actually three things to show here:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> we describe is actually a function. That is, for each <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>, there is exactly one <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(a)=b\)</span>. This is true because the <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> are all different: if <span class="math inline">\(a_1=a_2\)</span>, then we might have a problem. But we don’t, since we assumed that these were exactly the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is one to one. This is because, for any <span class="math inline">\(i \neq j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_i \neq b_j\)</span>. Again, for the same reason as before, we assume that <span class="math inline">\(b_1, \ldots, b_n\)</span> are exactly the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is onto. Again, since <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has exactly <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements, we see that every <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span> must be labeled as <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span>, for some <span class="math inline">\(i \leq n\)</span>. That means <span class="math inline">\(f(a_i)=b\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is in the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cardinality">Cardinality</h2>
<p>Our theorem above provides motivation for our following definition.</p>
<p>Definition: Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be (possibly infinite) sets. Then <span class="math inline">\(|A| = |B|\)</span>, read “the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is equal to the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>”, if there is a bijection <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span>.<br />
The word “cardinality” is now going to be used to generalize the meaning of “size” to infinite sets. This was Cantor’s main observation: that really when we “count” finite sets, we are putting that set in bijection with with a set of the form <span class="math inline">\(\{1, 2, \ldots, n \}\)</span>. Indeed: when we say that a set has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements, we list out those <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements as <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\)</span>. This is a bijection: <span class="math inline">\(i \mapsto a_i!\)</span>! Take any finite set you can think of. For example, take the set of capital letters of the English alphabet. Putting them in alphabetical order puts them in bijection with the set of integers from 1 to 26 (inclusive): <span class="math inline">\(1 \mapsto ‘A’\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2 \mapsto ‘B’\)</span>, etc.<br />
What Cantor did, then, was to take this observation, and turn it into a definition. How do we make sense of two infinite sets being the same size? If we can “count” one using the other set as our “labels”.</p>
<h2 id="natural-numbers-and-evens">Natural Numbers and Evens</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{N} = \{ x :\)</span> there is <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x=2n \}\)</span> denote the set of even natural numbers. This is the set of numbers that can be formed by multiplying a natural number by 2.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to 2\mathbb{N}\)</span> be defined by <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=2n\)</span>.This is a bijection! That means that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{N}| = |2\mathbb{N}|\)</span>. This is strange, since <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is clearly “bigger” than <span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{N}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{N}\)</span> , and then there are all the odd numbers like and then there are all the odd numbers like <span class="math inline">\(1, 3, \ldots\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N} \setminus 2\mathbb{N}\)</span> is also infinite. But this is the paradoxical nature of infinity. Infinite sets can be put into bijection with seemingly smaller sets. . So is also infinite. But this is the paradoxical nature of infinity. Infinite sets can be put into bijection with seemingly smaller sets.<br />
Why is this function a bijection? Let’s prove it. We will first show the contrapositive of the statement that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an injection. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are natural numbers and <span class="math inline">\(2m=2n\)</span>. Simple algebra then tells us that <span class="math inline">\(m=n\)</span>. This is the contrapositive of “If <span class="math inline">\(m \neq n\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(m) \neq f(n)\)</span>.”<br />
Now let’s show that it is a surjection. Let <span class="math inline">\(y \in 2\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Then there is <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(y=2n\)</span>. So by definition, <span class="math inline">\(f(n) = y\)</span>.</p>
