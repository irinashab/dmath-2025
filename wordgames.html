<h2>Part 1: Playing with Words and Permutations with Repetition</h2>

<p>Let's start with a game. How many different words (or anagrams) can we form by rearranging the letters of:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>SHABLINSKY</strong></li>
  <li><strong>MATHEMATICA</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>For <strong>SHABLINSKY</strong>, all 10 letters are unique. The number of arrangements is simply the number of permutations of 10 distinct items:</p>
<p>\[10! = 3,628,800\]</p>

<p>For <strong>MATHEMATICA</strong>, the letters are not all unique. We have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>M: 2</li>
  <li>A: 3</li>
  <li>T: 2</li>
  <li>H: 1</li>
  <li>E: 1</li>
  <li>I: 1</li>
  <li>C: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>If all 11 letters were unique, we'd have \(11!\) arrangements. However, swapping the two M's doesn't create a new word, so \(11!\) overcounts. We must divide by the number of ways to arrange the identical letters amongst themselves.</p>

<p><strong>The Formula for Permutations with Repetition:</strong><br>
The number of distinct arrangements of a word with \(n\) total letters, where there are \(n_1\) of one type, \(n_2\) of another, etc., is:</p>
<p>\[\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot n_3! \cdot \ldots}\]</p>

<p>So, for <strong>MATHEMATICA</strong>:</p>
<p>\[\frac{11!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{39,916,800}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 2} = \frac{39,916,800}{24} = 1,663,200\]</p>

<p>This concept of counting arrangements, or "playing with words," is incredibly powerful. Let's see how it unlocks one of the most important theorems in algebra.</p>

<h2>Part 2: The Binomial Theorem as a Word Game</h2>

<p>What is \((a + b)^3\)? We know:</p>
<p>\[(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\]</p>

<p>But where do the coefficients 1, 3, 3, 1 come from? Let's think of it as a word game.</p>
<p>\[(a + b)^3 = (a + b)(a + b)(a + b)\]</p>
<p>When we expand this, we are making a choice from each bracket: \(a\) or \(b\). Every possible product is a string of three letters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The term \(a^3\) comes from choosing \(a\) from every bracket: \(aaa\). There's only <strong>1</strong> such word.</li>
  <li>The term \(a^2b\) comes from words with two \(a\)s and one \(b\): \(aab\), \(aba\), \(baa\). There are <strong>3</strong> such words.</li>
  <li>The term \(ab^2\) comes from words with one \(a\) and two \(b\)s: \(abb\), \(bab\), \(bba\). There are <strong>3</strong> such words.</li>
  <li>The term \(b^3\) comes from \(bbb\). There's only <strong>1</strong> such word.</li>
</ul>

<p>The coefficient of \(a^2b\) is the number of distinct 3-letter words with 2 \(a\)s and 1 \(b\). We just calculated that using our formula:</p>
<p>\[\frac{3!}{2! \cdot 1!} = 3\]</p>

<p>This works in general! For \((a + b)^n\), the expansion is:</p>
<p>\[(a + b)^n = (a + b)(a + b)...(a + b) \quad \text{(n times)}\]</p>
<p>The term \(a^k b^{n-k}\) comes from choosing \(a\) exactly \(k\) times and \(b\) exactly \((n-k)\) times. The number of such sequences is the number of words with \(k\) \(a\)s and \((n-k)\) \(b\)s:</p>
<p>\[\frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!}\]</p>

<p>This is the <strong>binomial coefficient</strong>, denoted \(C_n^k\) or \(\binom{n}{k}\).</p>

<p><strong>The Binomial Theorem:</strong></p>
<p>\[(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^k b^{n-k}\]</p>

<h2>Part 3: The Spider Problem and Pascal's Triangle</h2>

<p>Let's visualize this with a famous problem. A spider in the top-left corner of a grid must get to the bottom-right corner, moving only <strong>Right (R)</strong> or <strong>Down (D)</strong>.</p>

<p>In a \(4 \times 5\) grid, to get from one corner to the other, the spider must take 3 Down moves and 4 Right moves. Any path is a sequence of 7 moves, e.g., \(R R D R D R R\).</p>

<p><strong>This is just another word game!</strong> Each path is a unique arrangement of the letters \(D, D, D, R, R, R, R\). The total number of paths is:</p>
<p>\[\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4! \cdot 3!} = 35\]</p>

<p>If we fill a grid, writing in each cell the number of paths to reach it, a beautiful pattern emerges. The number in each cell is the sum of the numbers above it and to its left.</p>

<table class="grid-table">
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td><strong>35</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This grid, when rotated, is <strong>Pascal's Triangle</strong>, and every number is a binomial coefficient! The number 35 is \(\binom{7}{4}\).</p>

<p>This gives us a profound insight: <strong>The recursive property of Pascal's Triangle (each number is the sum of the two above it) is a direct result of the path-counting rule.</strong></p>

<p>This leads to the fundamental identity for binomial coefficients:</p>
<p>\[\binom{n+1}{k+1} = \binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k+1}\]</p>

<p>We can prove this combinatorially: to choose \((k+1)\) people from \((n+1)\), we either include a specific person (and choose \(k\) from the remaining \(n\)) or exclude them (and choose \(k+1\) from the remaining \(n\)).</p>

<details>
<summary>Click for combinatorial proof</summary>
<p>Consider choosing \(k+1\) people from a group of \(n+1\). Pick one specific person. There are two cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Include the specific person. Then we need to choose \(k\) more people from the remaining \(n\): \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways.</li>
  <li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Exclude the specific person. Then we need to choose all \(k+1\) people from the remaining \(n\): \(\binom{n}{k+1}\) ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since these cases are mutually exclusive, the total is \(\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k+1}\).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have traveled a full circle:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We started with <strong>words</strong>, deriving a formula for permutations with repetition.</li>
  <li>We applied it to <strong>algebra</strong>, discovering the Binomial Theorem by viewing polynomial expansion as a word game.</li>
  <li>We saw the same coefficients appear in a <strong>geometric path-counting problem</strong> (the spider).</li>
  <li>This problem visually generated <strong>Pascal's Triangle</strong> and revealed the recursive relationship between binomial coefficients.</li>
</ol>

<p>This unified view shows the power of combinatorics: the same simple idea of counting arrangements connects seemingly disparate areas of mathematics.</p>
