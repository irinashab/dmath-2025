<p>In today’s lesson, we will study this question closely about when there is a bijection between two infinite sets. We will first look at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Sets that can be put in bijection with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> are called <strong>countably infinite</strong>. Sets that are either finite or <strong>countably infinite</strong> are called <strong>countable</strong>. Often times the word countable is used to mean countably infinite, but this should be clear from the context (if a set is countably and clearly not finite, it’s countably infinite). The cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_0\)</span>, read “aleph null” or “aleph naught”. is referred to as the “smallest infinite cardinality”.<br />
Last time, we saw that <span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{N}\)</span>, the set of even numbers, is countably infinite. We saw that <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to 2\mathbb{N}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=2n\)</span> is a bijection.</p>
<h2 id="symmetry">Symmetry</h2>
<p>Ideally, <span class="math inline">\(|A|=|B|\)</span> should mean the same thing as <span class="math inline">\(|B|=|A|\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\(|A|=|B|\)</span> means that there is a bijection <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(|B|=|A|\)</span> means that there is a bijection <span class="math inline">\(g : B \to A\)</span>. So technically, they do not mean the same thing. But we can prove that these two statements are logically equivalent: if there is a bijection <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span>, then there is <em>another bijection</em> <span class="math inline">\(g : B \to A\)</span>. We say that cardinality is <strong>symmetric</strong>: if there’s a bijection from one set to another, there is another one backward.<br />
Let’s only look at an example here, but you should be prepared to prove a statement like this (on a problem set). We saw that <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to 2\mathbb{N}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=2n\)</span> is a bijection. Can we find a bijection <span class="math inline">\(g : 2\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\)</span>?<br />
Start with an even natural number <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. By definition, that means there is some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(2n=y\)</span>. So let’s let <span class="math inline">\(g(y)=n\)</span>. That is, let’s let <span class="math inline">\(g(y) = \dfrac{y}{2}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is an even number, we can divide it by 2, and still get a natural number.</p>
<p>Why is this a bijection? First, it’s one to one. If <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{x}{2} = \dfrac{y}{2}\)</span>, then by algebra we get <span class="math inline">\(x=y\)</span>. And it’s onto: if <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(y=2n\)</span> , and <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{2n}{2} = n\)</span>.<br />
More generally: what did we do here? What’s the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>?</p>
<h2 id="integers">Integers</h2>
<p>Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is the set of all integers, and so it contains <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> as well as <span class="math inline">\(-1, -2, -3, \ldots\)</span> We will show that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{N}|=|\mathbb{Z}|\)</span>. So again we will see an example of an infinite set that contains a “smaller” infinite set, but the two can be matched up in a one to one correspondence.<br />
The idea here is that we can “re-order” the integers starting at 0 and going outward. That is, we can write the integers down in the order <span class="math inline">\(0, -1, 1, -2, 2, \ldots\)</span>, alternating between negatives and positives. We have not written down, explicitly, the bijection, but we could write one down as a piecewise function: <span class="math display">\[f(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{n}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } n \mbox{ is even}\\
    -\frac{n+1}{2} &amp;\mbox{if } n \mbox{ is odd}\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{O}\)</span> be the set of odd numbers. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(f(2\mathbb{N})\)</span>, the image of the set of even numbers, is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, for the same reason that the function <span class="math inline">\(g: 2\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\)</span> in the previous section was a bijection. Also notice that <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbb{O})\)</span> is the set of all negative integers: <span class="math inline">\(f(1) = -1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(3) = -2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(5) = -3\)</span>, etc. This is not a proof, but a formal proof could be given later on.</p>
<h2 id="transitivity">Transitivity</h2>
<p>So far we have seen that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{N}| = |2\mathbb{N}|\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{Z}|\)</span>. We might expect, then that <span class="math inline">\(|2\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{Z}|\)</span>. We would be correct!<br />
In general, cardinality is <strong>transitive</strong>: if we have three sets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|A|=|B|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|B|=|C|\)</span> , then <span class="math inline">\(|A|=|C|\)</span>. How might we prove this? We need to show: if we have a bijection <span class="math inline">\(f: A \to B\)</span> and a bijection <span class="math inline">\(g: B \to C\)</span>, that we can find a bijection <span class="math inline">\(h : A \to C\)</span>. Again, I will ask you to prove this in general, but let’s look at a specific example here.<br />
We want to map the numbers <span class="math inline">\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots\)</span> to the numbers <span class="math inline">\(\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\)</span>. How might we do this? Well, we have a rule which puts the numbers <span class="math inline">\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots\)</span> in one to one correspondence with <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\)</span>, and a rule which puts in a one to one correspondence with all integers <span class="math inline">\(\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\)</span>.<br />
So let’s combine these two rules! That is, given an even number <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we find the natural number it’s associated with, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Then we look up the integer,<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, that is associated with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. That’s how we define <span class="math inline">\(F : 2\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(F(y)\)</span> will be that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.<br />
Let’s check a few examples. Remember the two bijections we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Starting with <span class="math inline">\(y \in 2\mathbb{N}\)</span> we get <span class="math inline">\(n = \frac{y}{2}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>the map from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> was defined piecewise: if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even, then <span class="math inline">\(n \mapsto \frac{n}{2}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd, then <span class="math inline">\(n \mapsto -\frac{n+1}{2}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{0}{2}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, which is even. So we again divide that by 2, and <span class="math inline">\(F(0)=0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{2}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, which is odd. So <span class="math inline">\(F(2)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{1 + 1}{2}\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(-11\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{2}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, which is even. We again divide that by 2, and <span class="math inline">\(F(4)=2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We are not proving it here, but <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is, in fact, a bijection. Proving that it is a bijection would basically involve the same steps as proving the more general statement, so we will skip this for now.</p>
<h2 id="positive-rationals">Positive Rationals</h2>
<p>Our proof that the integers are countably infinite boils down to this fact: we can list all integers in an infinite sequence, such that each integer shows up at some finite position (and shows up exactly once). We list the integers as <span class="math inline">\(0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, -4, 4, \ldots\)</span>. The rule we gave above turns this from an “infinite sequence” into an explicit function <span class="math inline">\(h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, but the actual rule is not so important as the fact that there is a way to list these numbers out.<br />
The caveat here that each integers shows up at a finite position is important. The listing <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, -1, -2, -3, -4, \ldots\)</span> is not a valid “infinite sequence” in this sense. At which position does <span class="math inline">\(-5\)</span> show up?<br />
Now let’s consider the rational numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q} = \{ \frac{m}{n} : m, n \in \mathbb{Z}, n \neq 0 \}\)</span>. Are the rational numbers also countably infinite? Is there a way to list out all rational numbers in an infinite sequence? It’s not entirely obvious: if we start by listing out all the integers, we will miss out on numbers likes <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\)</span>, etc. If we start by listing out all the numbers whose denominator is <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, we will miss out on <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>.<br />
It’s not clear at all how we might do this! One would be forgiven for believing there is no way to list out all rational numbers in an infinite sequence. But there is a way!<br />
For now, we will only list out the positive rational numbers. The first step is to write out all possible rational numbers in an infinite 2-dimensional array. The number on the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>-th row and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th column will be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{n}\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/r0.png" alt="organizing rations into a table"width="500" /></p>
<p>Then start at the top left and “spiral around”, ignoring fractions which can be reduced. So we end up with the listing: <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{1}{3}, 3, 4, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{2}{3}, \dfrac{1}{4}, \ldots\)</span><br />
This spiraling is visualized in the following image: start at 1/1 on the top left, and then follow along the arrows, ignoring numbers that can be reduced (these are pointed out in red). Every rational number, expressed as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{p}{q}\)</span> in simplest form, will show up in this array on the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th row and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>-th column, and that position will be seen in finitely many steps. So that means this infinite listing we have will list out all positive rational numbers.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/r1.png" alt="Rationals are countable" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How might you extend this result to show that all of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> is countable? Any ideas using <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and transitivity?<br />
<strong>Question:</strong> How might you use this idea to similarly show that the set of all ordered pairs of integers is countable?</p>
<h2 id="real-numbers">Real Numbers</h2>
<p>At this point, you would be forgiven for thinking, as many mathematicians in history did, that all infinite sets have the same size, and that formalizing this notion using bijections and cardinality is just proving what we already know.<br />
Of course, I already hinted that there are uncountable infinite sets! In fact, there are many, but the most natural uncountably infinite set is the set of real numbers, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.<br />
How might we prove that this set is not countable? Before we try to write a real proof, we can check that we don’t know of any bijection between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. For example, the function <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(n) = \sqrt{n}\)</span> is not a bijection: <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is not in the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.<br />
But we need something stronger than just “Every function I’ve looked at is not a bijection.” We need to show that there is <strong>no</strong> bijection. This is saying: “I can prove that, for every single function <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>, something goes wrong.”<br />
That is, if I looked at a few functions, and showed that they weren’t bijections, that’s not enough. Maybe the square root example we thought of just wasn’t clever enough. Perhaps we just weren’t clever enough in coming up with the rule, like what happened with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>? If we really want to prove that there is no bijection, we have to give an argument that works for every function <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>.<br />
That is, given a function <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>, we have to show that is not a bijection. In fact, what we will show is that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not a surjection: it’s not onto. We will argue in a very general way, so that this argument can be applied to every function from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, thereby showing there is no surjection from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.<br />
The idea will be to find a real number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> which is different from <span class="math inline">\(f(0)\)</span>, different from <span class="math inline">\(f(1)\)</span>, different from <span class="math inline">\(f(2)\)</span>, etc. This was <strong>Cantor’s Diagonal Argument</strong>: if you list out the numbers <span class="math inline">\(f(0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(2)\)</span>,...,etc in a vertical table, you can find a real number that’s not on that list by picking a number whose <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th digit after the decimal place is different from that of <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span>. To make this rule concrete, let’s say that our number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is defined by the following rule: if the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th digit of <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, then the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th digit of <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> will be 2. Otherwise, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th digit of <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> will be 1.<br />
What does that mean? Let’s look at an example. Suppose is given by the following table:</p>
<p>f(0) &amp;= 0.131569108 …<br />
f(1) &amp;= 2.718281828 …<br />
f(2) &amp;= 3.141592653 …<br />
f(3) &amp;= 1.741213562 …<br />
f(4) &amp;= 2.618128176 …<br />
⋮</p>
<p>Let’s look at the diagonal digits here:</p>
<p>f(0) &amp;= .131569108 …<br />
f(1) &amp;= 2.18281828 …<br />
f(2) &amp;= 3.11592653 …<br />
f(3) &amp;= 1.74213562 …<br />
f(4) &amp;= 2.61828176 …<br />
⋮</p>
<p>If we apply the diagonal argument, we end up with a number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> that starts off as <span class="math inline">\(1.1122...\)</span>. We know that this number we end up with cannot be on this list! That’s because the number won’t be equal to <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>: at the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th place after the decimal, <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> are different!<br />
This is a subtle argument: for each <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, there is a different <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> that we can find that is not in the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. So there is no way for a function <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> to be a surjection. In terms of cardinality, this means <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{R}| \neq \aleph_0\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="infinite-binary-sequences">Infinite Binary Sequences</h2>
<p>A very similar argument can be given to show that the set of all infinite binary sequences is uncountable. Let’s first define what infinite binary sequences are:<br />
<strong>Definition:</strong> An infinite binary sequence is a function <span class="math inline">\(s : \mathbb{N} \to \{ 0, 1 \}\)</span>.<br />
This might be a strange definition of a sequence, but recall, before, that functions whose domain is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> really can be thought of as infinite sequences: the first element of the sequence is <span class="math inline">\(f(0)\)</span>, the next element is <span class="math inline">\(f(1)\)</span>, then comes <span class="math inline">\(f(2)\)</span> etc.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">\(B = \{ s : s\)</span> is an infinite binary sequence<span class="math inline">\(\}\)</span> . How might you show that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is uncountable using a “Diagonal” argument? You would again try to make an argument that shows that no <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to B\)</span> is a surjection. So you would look at <span class="math inline">\(f(0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(2)\)</span>,...,etc. Each <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> is an infinite binary sequence. And you would try to construct a new infinite binary sequence that’s different from each <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> in some way. Can you think of how to do this?</p>
