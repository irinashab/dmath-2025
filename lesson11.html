<h2 id="part1">Part 1: Finding the Day of the Week with the Doomsday Algorithm</h2>

<h3 id="history">1.0 A Brief History of Our Calendar: From Chaos to Order</h3>

<p>To understand the rules of the Doomsday Algorithm, especially its handling of leap years, we must first understand why our calendar has the structure it does. Its development was a long process of correcting errors to align human timekeeping with astronomical reality.</p>

<p><strong>The Roman Calendar (Pre-46 BC):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The early Roman calendar was a lunar-based system of about 355 days, constantly falling out of sync with the solar year.</li>
  <li>An extra month was occasionally added by pontiffs, often for political reasons, leading to significant chaos and inaccuracy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Julian Reform (46 BC):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduced by Julius Caesar, advised by the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria.</li>
  <li>This was a monumental shift to a <strong>solar-based calendar</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Feature:</strong> The year was set to 365.25 days. This was implemented by having a year of 365 days, with an extra day—a <strong>leap day</strong>—added every four years without exception.</li>
  <li>The "Julian Calendar" was a vast improvement and brought much-needed stability. However, the solar year is actually approximately <strong>365.2422 days</strong>, not 365.25. This small difference of about 11 minutes per year began to accumulate over centuries.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Gregorian Reform (1582):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>By the 16th century, the Julian calendar's drift had added up to about 10 days. The date of the vernal equinox, critical for calculating Easter, had shifted significantly from its traditional date of March 21.</li>
  <li>Pope Gregory XIII introduced a new calendar to correct this drift.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Corrections:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>The One-Time Reset:</strong> 10 days were skipped. The day after October 4, 1582, was declared October 15, 1582.</li>
      <li><strong>The New Leap Year Rule:</strong> The simple 4-year leap year cycle was refined. A year divisible by 4 is a leap year, <strong>unless</strong> it is a century year (divisible by 100). <strong>However</strong>, century years divisible by 400 <strong>are</strong> leap years.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> The year 1900 was <em>not</em> a leap year (divisible by 100 but not by 400), but the year 2000 <em>was</em> a leap year (divisible by 400).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This Gregorian calendar, with its specific leap-year rules, is the system the Doomsday Algorithm is built upon. The algorithm's need to handle century years differently is a direct consequence of this 16th-century reform.</p>

<h3 id="concept">1.1 The Core Concept of the Doomsday Algorithm</h3>

<p>The Doomsday Algorithm, popularized by mathematician John Conway, is a method for mentally calculating the day of the week for any date in the Gregorian calendar. It relies on a simple principle: every year has a "Doomsday"—a specific day of the week on which several easy-to-remember dates always fall. Once you know the year's Doomsday, you can find the day for any other date by counting forward or backward from one of these key dates.</p>

<h3 id="keydates">1.2 The Key Dates</h3>

<p>To use the algorithm, you must memorize a set of key dates that always fall on the Doomsday. Mnemonics make this easier.</p>

<h3 id="calculation">1.3 Calculating the Doomsday for a Year</h3>

<p>The formula for finding the Doomsday (D) for any year in the 20th and 21st centuries is:</p>

<p>\[ D = D_{2000} + Y + L \ (\text{mod}\ 7) \]</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( D_{2000} \) is the anchor Doomsday for the year 2000, which was a <strong>Tuesday (2)</strong>.</li>
  <li>\( Y \) is the last two digits of the year.</li>
  <li>\( L \) is the integer result of \( Y \) divided by 4 (i.e., the number of leap years within those years).</li>
  <li>The result is taken modulo 7, where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 1: Find the day of the week for May 15, 2020</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Find Doomsday for 2020</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>\( Y = 20 \), \( L = 20/4 = 5 \)</li>
      <li>\( D_{2020} = 2 + 20 + 5 = 27 \)</li>
      <li>\( 27 \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 6 \) → <strong>Saturday</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Step 2: Use a key date</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The key date for May is May 9, which is a Saturday.</li>
      <li>May 15 is 6 days after May 9.</li>
      <li>\( 6 + 6 = 12 \), and \( 12 \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 5 \) → <strong>Friday</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 2: Find the day of the week for September 11, 1996</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Find Doomsday for 1996</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>\( D_{1900} = 3 \) (Wednesday), \( Y = 96 \), \( L = 96/4 = 24 \)</li>
      <li>\( D_{1996} = 3 + 96 + 24 = 123 \)</li>
      <li>\( 123 \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 4 \) → <strong>Thursday</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Step 2: Use a key date</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The key date for September is September 5, which is a Thursday.</li>
      <li>September 11 is 6 days after September 5.</li>
      <li>\( 6 + 4 = 10 \), and \( 10 \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 3 \) → <strong>Wednesday</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 3: Find the day of the week for November 22, 1963</strong></p>

<p>This is a famous date in 20th-century history. Let's calculate its day of the week.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Find Doomsday for 1963</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We know from our century table that \( D_{1900} = 3 \) (Wednesday).</li>
      <li>\( Y = 63 \) (the last two digits of the year).</li>
      <li>\( L = \lfloor 63 / 4 \rfloor = 15 \) (the number of leap years since the start of the century).</li>
      <li>\( D_{1963} = D_{1900} + Y + L \ (\text{mod}\ 7) \)</li>
      <li>\( D_{1963} = 3 + 63 + 15 \)</li>
      <li>\( D_{1963} = 81 \)</li>
      <li>\( 81 \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 4 \) (because 77 is 11*7, and 81-77=4) → <strong>Thursday</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Step 2: Use a key date</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The key date for November is November 7 ("9-to-5 at 7-11"), which is a Thursday in 1963.</li>
      <li>Our target date is November 22.</li>
      <li>The difference: November 22 - November 7 = <strong>15 days</strong>.</li>
      <li>Now, we find the day of the week by moving forward 15 days from Thursday.</li>
      <li>\( 15 \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 1 \) (because 14 is 2*7, and 15-14=1). This means we move forward <strong>1 day</strong> from the key date.</li>
      <li>Thursday + 1 day = <strong>Friday</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Therefore, November 22, 1963, was a Friday.</strong></p>

<h3 id="centuries">1.4 Handling Other Centuries</h3>

<p>As we learned from the historical context, the Gregorian calendar skips leap days on century years not divisible by 400. This affects the Doomsday calculation for centuries.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> For a century whose '00' year is <strong>not</strong> a leap year (like 1900), its Doomsday is <strong>2 days earlier</strong> than the previous century's. If it <strong>is</strong> a leap year (like 2000), it is only <strong>1 day earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Example: When was the Declaration of Independence signed? (July 4, 1776)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The anchor for the 1700s is \( D_{1700} = 0 \) (Sunday).</li>
  <li>\( Y = 76 \), \( L = 76/4 = 19 \)</li>
  <li>\( D_{1776} = 0 + 76 + 19 = 95 \)</li>
  <li>\( 95 \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 4 \) → <strong>Thursday</strong></li>
  <li>Since July 4 is always on the Doomsday, it was signed on a <strong>Thursday</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="part2">Part 2: Calculating the Date of Easter with Gauss's Algorithm</h2>

<h3 id="challenge">2.1 The Challenge of Easter</h3>

<p>Easter Sunday is a movable feast based on lunar cycles. It falls on the <strong>first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon</strong>—the first full moon after the vernal equinox. The calculation uses fixed "ecclesiastic" dates for the equinox (March 21) and full moons, which sometimes differ from astronomical events.</p>

<h3 id="gauss">2.2 Gauss's Algorithm Step-by-Step</h3>

<p>Here is the algorithm to compute the date of Easter for any given year.</p>

<p><strong>Variables:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>\( a = \text{year} \ (\text{mod}\ 19) \) // Position in the 19-year Metonic lunar cycle.</li>
  <li>\( b = \text{year} \ (\text{mod}\ 4) \) // Correction for the solar year's extra day.</li>
  <li>\( c = \text{year} \ (\text{mod}\ 7) \) // Related to the progression of weekdays.</li>
  <li>\( k = \lfloor \text{year}/100 \rfloor \) // The century.</li>
  <li>\( p = \lfloor (13 + 8k)/25 \rfloor \) // A correction for the lunar orbit.</li>
  <li>\( q = \lfloor k/4 \rfloor \) // Reinstates the leap day every 400 years.</li>
  <li>\( M = (15 − p + k − q) \ \text{mod}\ 30 \) // The starting point for the full moon for the century.</li>
  <li>\( N = (4 + k − q) \ \text{mod}\ 7 \) // The cycle of weekdays for the ecclesiastic moon in that century.</li>
  <li>\( d = (19a + M) \ \text{mod}\ 30 \) // Number of days from March 21 to the Paschal full moon.</li>
  <li>\( e = (2b + 4c + 6d + N) \ \text{mod}\ 7 \) // Days from the full moon to the next Sunday.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Date:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Easter is either <strong>March (22 + d + e)</strong> or <strong>April (d + e − 9)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Special Exceptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If \( d = 29 \) and \( e = 6 \), Easter is <strong>April 19</strong> instead of April 26.</li>
  <li>If \( d = 28 \), \( e = 6 \), and \( (11M + 11) \ \text{mod}\ 30 < 19 \), Easter is <strong>April 18</strong> instead of April 25.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="basis">2.3 Conceptual Basis</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>\(a\) and the 19-year cycle:</strong> The lunar month is ~29.5 days. 235 lunar months almost exactly equals 19 solar years. The variable \(a\) tracks our position in this cycle.</li>
  <li><strong>Leap Year Corrections (\(k, q\)):</strong> The terms \(k\) and \(q\) account for the Gregorian rule of skipping leap days on century years unless divisible by 400.</li>
  <li><strong>Finding Sunday (\(e\)):</strong> The expression \(2b + 4c\) accounts for the fact that a 365-day year is 52 weeks and 1 day, pushing the weekday forward by one each year. Adding \(6d\) is equivalent to subtracting \(d\), adjusting for the delay of the full moon.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="easter-example">2.4 Example: Find Easter in 2020</h3>

<ol>
  <li>\( a = 2020 \ (\text{mod}\ 19) = 6 \)</li>
  <li>\( b = 2020 \ (\text{mod}\ 4) = 0 \)</li>
  <li>\( c = 2020 \ (\text{mod}\ 7) = 4 \)</li>
  <li>\( k = \lfloor 2020/100 \rfloor = 20 \)</li>
  <li>\( p = \lfloor (13 + 8*20)/25 \rfloor = 7 \)</li>
  <li>\( q = \lfloor 20/4 \rfloor = 5 \)</li>
  <li>\( M = (15 − 7 + 20 − 5) \ \text{mod}\ 30 = 23 \)</li>
  <li>\( N = (4 + 20 − 5) \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 5 \)</li>
  <li>\( d = (19*6 + 23) \ \text{mod}\ 30 = 137 \ \text{mod}\ 30 = 17 \)</li>
  <li>\( e = (2*0 + 4*4 + 6*17 + 5) \ \text{mod}\ 7 = (0+16+102+5) \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 123 \ \text{mod}\ 7 = 4 \)</li>
  <li><strong>Date:</strong> \( d + e - 9 = 17 + 4 - 9 = 12 \)</li>
  <li><strong>Easter 2020: April 12</strong></li>
</ol>
