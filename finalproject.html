    <h1>Description</h1>
    
    <p>The group final project consists of a presentation and a paper. The presentation should be about <strong>15 minutes</strong> in length (do not go over that time!). The format will be determined later (either in class on the last day of class, or online via VoiceThread).</p>
    
    <p>Your group decides on a topic related to our course in some way. Some examples include:</p>
    
    <h2>Logic</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-classical Logics: relevance logics, many-valued logics (logics with options besides "T" and "F"), modal logic, intuitionistic logic (can discuss usage of any of these in philosophy)</li>
        <li>Satisfiability solvers: heuristic algorithms which attempt to solve the "satisfiability" problem</li>
        <li>Godel's Incompleteness Theorems / undecidability of "satisfaction" of arithmetic.
            <ul>
                <li>This is a result that says that there is no algorithm (you can think of an algorithm as a computer program you can write in any of your favorite languages) which determines, given a statement in first order logic (with predicates for addition, multiplication, and the ordering &lt; (less then)), whether that statement is true in the natural numbers.</li>
                <li>This theorem has fascinating mathematical and philosophical implications.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Set Theory</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Paradoxes in naive set theory and their resolutions in axiomatic set theory (can dive into the history a bit, as well as the philosophy behind some of the axioms)</li>
        <li>Cardinalities of Power sets / Cantor's Paradox (there is no set of all cardinalities)</li>
        <li>The Axiom of Choice, equivalent forms, and its controversies</li>
        <li>Cantor-Schroder-Bernstein Theorem: If there is an injection from A to B and an injection from B to A, then |A| = |B|.
            <ul>
                <li>What about surjections? (There is a corresponding result, which requires the axiom of choice)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ordinal and cardinal arithmetic</li>
        <li>Encoding mathematical objects in set theory (ordered pairs as particular sets, natural numbers as particular von Neumann ordinals, construction of Z/Q/R from N). Can touch on philosophy of mathematics (formalism and platonism in particular)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Counting / Arrangements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Discrete Probability</li>
        <li>Counting problems involving more constraints (arranging people in specified order, counting words with repeated letters, etc)</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Show that Big Theta is an equivalence relation. Determine its equivalence classes. Show that Big Oh is a linear order of those classes.</li>
        <li>Define "lim sup", and show that Big Oh can be defined in terms of lim sup.

            </ul>

        <li>Chinese Remainder Theorem / applications</li>
        <li>Modular arithmetic: multiplication mod n if n is prime vs composite / Euler totient function</li>
        <li>Modular arithmetic algorithms (multiplication, exponentiation, etc) / running times</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Relations, Orderings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Other kinds of partial orders: lattices, boolean algebras, complete lattices, distributive lattices, etc. (Examples of such orders, and where they arise in mathematics)</li>
        <li>Other types of relations: pre-orders (reflexive + transitive), reflexive + symmetric but non-transitive relations. ("Real" and/or mathematical examples of these)</li>
    </ul>

        <li>"Centrality" notions in networks: degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, etc. Applications in network analysis.</li>
        <li>NP-complete graph theory problems: the traveling salesmen problem, vertex cover problem, k-clique problem, k-coloring problem, Hamiltonian circuit problem, etc.
            <ul>
                <li>Pick any one of these, explain why its in the class NP, explain some of the history of attempts to solve this problem, etc</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Infinite graphs: the countable random graph, the infinite complete graph (Ramsey's theorem)</li>
        <li>The complete infinite binary tree (countably many nodes, uncountably many branches)</li>
        <li>(Directed) graphs of ordinary mathematical structures (natural numbers, integers, or rationals, with a directed edge from x to y if x &lt; y).
            <ul>
                <li>Automorphisms of these graphs: prove that there the only automorphism of the natural number graph is the identity function, that there are countably many automorphisms of the integer graph, and that there are uncountably many automorphisms of the rationals graph</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Again, many, many other topics.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is <strong>absolutely not an exhaustive list</strong>. If you are interested in other topics that are (tangentially) related to our course, feel free to suggest some. Of course, some of these topics have not quite been introduced in our course, and so you can do some research to determine if you are interested in that.</p>
    
    <p>There are many other topics you might be interested in. See what you can find by searching the internet a little bit to find some resources.</p>
    
    <h2>Rubric</h2>
    
    <p>For the presentation, focus on the "Big Picture" ideas. That is, you should focus on providing <strong>context</strong> and <strong>background/motivation</strong> for your topic. This background can be historical, philosophical, mathematical, or it can just answer the question: why are we interested in this topic? That answer can vary depending on the topic: computer scientists are interested in graph algorithms for a very different reason than philosophers are interested in non-classical logics. So be sure to ground your topic in the broader area of research that it fits into (whether that is in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, philosophy of mathematics, or another area of research entirely). Try to find good, motivating examples of problems to go over in your short time here, which illustrate the main results / theorems / techniques of your topic.</p>
    
    <p>The presentations will be graded on a 1-5 scale as follows:</p>
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>1 point:</strong> No context given for this topic</p>
    </div>

    
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>2 points:</strong> Some context provided for the topic, without much motivation</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>3 points:</strong> Adequate context / motivation provided with minimal examples</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>4 points:</strong> Presenters explained the context for the topic, and provided strong motivating and/or historical examples</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>5 points:</strong> In addition to (4), presenters showed a deep understanding of why this topic is important in the context of some field of study.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>In your papers, you will get a chance to approach the topic in more depth. Your group should write an <strong>expository paper</strong> on your selected topic. The focus is pedagogical: to teach the reader (me) something new. Your paper should be thought of as an extension of the presentation: you should take the information you presented, and discuss it in more detail, depth, and/or otherwise cover it in a way that you weren't able to in the time constraints. Focus first on providing the necessary background/motivation, context, and a brief overview of the main results, definitions, theorems, algorithms, and/or proofs regarding your topic. That said, you should aim to provide some amount of depth on this paper. The papers will be due <strong>Friday, December 5</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Your group's paper will be graded on the following rubric (out of 10 points):</p>
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>2 points:</strong> Grammar and tone. This is academic writing, use proper grammar and do not write in a "personal" or "familiar" style. You should cite your sources properly (I will not worry so much about the format of your citations, just that you actually cite things internally when you write them)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>4 points:</strong> Background / motivation / context. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>3 points:</strong> Clarity.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rubric-item">
        <p><strong>1 point:</strong> Depth. Try to explain a concept as deeply as you can.</p>
    </div>
