<h2 id="principle">The Principle of Mathematical Induction</h2>
        
        <p>The Principle of Mathematical Induction is an important property of $\mathbb{N}$. Let $P(x)$ be any predicate. Then the following statement must be true, regardless of what $P(x)$ actually means!</p>
        
        <div class="math-box">$$[P(0) \land \forall x(P(x) \rightarrow P(x+1))] \rightarrow \forall x(P(x))$$</div>
        
        <p>What does this mean? Let's say $P(x)$ represents some property that a number $x$ could have. If 0 has this property, and, whenever $x$ has this property, then $x+1$ also does, then every number must have this property.</p>
        
        <p>This is the idea behind proof by induction. There are two parts to a proof by induction:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base case:</strong> show that $P(0)$ is true.</li>
            <li><strong>Inductive step:</strong> show that the statement $\forall x(P(x) \rightarrow P(x+1))$ is true.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The idea of proof by induction is often visualized using the example of dominoes: If you hit the first domino, and you know that whenever a domino is hit, then it will hit the next domino, then all the dominoes will eventually get hit.</p>

        <h2 id="sum-integers">Sum of First $n$ Integers</h2>
        
        <p>Let $P(n)$ be the property that</p>
        
        <div class="math-box">$$\sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$</div>
        
        <p>For any $n$, this is a true statement, and we gave the idea of a proof in an earlier lesson:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Add up the numbers $0 + 1 + 2 + ... + n$</li>
            <li>Reverse them, and add again: $n + (n-1) + ... + 1 + 0$</li>
            <li>Add them column-wise: $n + n + ... + n$. How many $n$'s are there? $n + 1$ (since there's one for each number from 0 to $n$).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Therefore adding those numbers twice gives $n(n+1)$, and so adding it just once would be half of that.</p>
        
        <p>But let's try to prove this same property using induction.</p>
        
        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Proof by Induction:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Base case:</strong> $P(0)$ is true because the sum of the integers from 0 to 0 is 0, and</p>
            <div class="math-box">$$\frac{0(1)}{2} = 0$$</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Inductive Step:</strong> We want to prove $\forall x(P(x) \rightarrow P(x+1))$. So let $x$ be an integer such that $P(x)$ is true. That is, suppose that $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{x} i = \frac{x(x+1)}{2}$. We want to show that $P(x+1)$ is also true.</p>
            
            <p>$P(x+1)$ is the statement that $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{x+1} i = \frac{(x+1)(x+2)}{2}$. Notice that $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{x+1} i = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{x} i + (x+1)$.</p>
            
            <p>Since $P(x)$ is true by our assumption, we know that $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{x} i = \frac{x(x+1)}{2}$. Therefore:</p>
            
            <div class="math-box">$$\sum\limits_{i=0}^{x+1} i = \frac{x(x+1)}{2} + x + 1$$</div>
            
            <p>Using algebra:</p>
            
            <div class="math-box">$$\frac{x(x+1)}{2} + \frac{2(x+1)}{2} = \frac{(x+1)(x+2)}{2}$$</div>
            
            <p>The last equality is achieved by factoring $(x+1)$.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="strategy">Strategy for Induction Proofs</h2>
        
        <p>The hardest part of a proof by induction is often the inductive step (not always! but often). One needs to think about how to show that if $P(x)$ is true, then $P(x+1)$ must be true, no matter what $x$ is. Recall the proof strategy for universal statements: let $x$ be an arbitrary element of the universe (in this case, $\mathbb{N}$). Then we have an if-then statement, so we assume that the antecedent is true and need to show the consequent.</p>
        
        <p>How do we prove that, if $x$ is an arbitrary integer such that $P(x)$ is true, then $P(x+1)$ must be true also? The idea is to find some way of transforming something we know about $x$ to something we know about $x+1$. In the above example, we needed to figure out a formula for $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{x+1} i$, supposing that we knew one for $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{x} i$. This is the general pattern: suppose you know something about a number $n$, use that to prove something about the number $n+1$.</p>
        
        <p>The thinking behind this is similar to the thinking you might find when studying recursion in computer programming: if you can solve a smaller problem, can you use solutions to that smaller problem to solve a larger problem?</p>

        <h2 id="power-sets">Power Sets</h2>
        
        <p>Notice the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>$|\emptyset| = 0$. $\mathcal{P}(\emptyset) = \{\emptyset\}$, which has size 1.</li>
            <li>Let $X = \{1\}$. Then $\mathcal{P}(X) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}\}$, size 2.</li>
            <li>Let $X = \{1, 2\}$. Then $\mathcal{P}(X) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\}$, size 4.</li>
            <li>Let $X = \{1, 2, 3\}$. Then:
                <div class="math-box">
                    \begin{align*}
                    \mathcal{P}(X) = \{ & \emptyset, \\
                    & \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \\
                    & \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2, 3\}, \\
                    & \{1, 2, 3\} \}
                    \end{align*}
                </div>
                which has size 8.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In general: it seems like the pattern is that adding one element to a set doubles the size of the power set. The power sets all have sizes that are increasing powers of 2: if $|X| = n$, then $|\mathcal{P}(X)| = 2^n$. How might we prove this? Let $P(n)$ represent the assertion "Every set of size $n$ has $2^n$ subsets." We can prove the base case:</p>
        
        <p>If $n = 0$, the only set of size 0 is the empty set. The only subset of the empty set is the empty set itself, and therefore the statement "Every set of size 0 has 1 subset" is true.</p>
        
        <p>Now we try to prove the inductive step. Let $n$ be any number and assume that $P(n)$ is true (inductive hypothesis): every set of size $n$ has $2^n$ subsets. We want to prove "Every set of size $n+1$ has $2^{n+1}$ subsets." So let $X$ be a set of size $n+1$. The strategy is to somehow find a way to use the fact that any set of size $n$ has $2^n$ subsets to count the number of subsets of $X$. How do we use this fact?</p>
        
        <p>We need to first get a set of size $n$. To get a set of size $n$ from a set of size $n+1$, just delete an element. Let's look at a quick example for $n=4$ first. Let $X = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. We know that the power set of $\{1, 2, 3\}$ has 8 elements. How many subsets are there of $X$? Well, all of the subsets of $\{1, 2, 3\}$ are also subsets of $X$, so there are at least those 8. The other subsets of $X$ are those which contain the number 4. How many subsets of $X$ are there which contain the number 4? A counting argument will give us 8 again: there are 3 yes/no questions to ask (is 1 in the set? Is 2? Is 3?).</p>
        
        <p>In fact, for any set $X$, if $a \in X$, there is a <em>bijection</em> between the subsets of $X$ which contain $a$ and the subsets of $X$ which don't. This bijection is given by taking a subset of $X$ which does not contain the element and adding in the element to that set. In the case $X = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $a = 4$:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>$\emptyset \mapsto \{4\}$</li>
            <li>$\{1\} \mapsto \{1, 4\}$</li>
            <li>$\{2\} \mapsto \{2, 4\}$</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Why is this a bijection? What is the domain and codomain of the function? The domain is the set $\{A \subseteq X : 4 \notin A\}$ and the codomain is $\{A \subseteq X : 4 \in A\}$. First let's show it's one to one. Let $A \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$. Assume that $A \cup \{4\} = B \cup \{4\}$. Then every element of $A$ is an element of $B \cup \{4\}$. But if $a \in A$, then $a \neq 4$, and so $a \in B$. Similarly, every element of $B$ can be shown to be an element of $A$.</p>
        
        <p>Now let's show that it's onto: let $A \subseteq \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and suppose $4 \in A$. We want to find a subset $B$ of $\{1, 2, 3\}$ such that $B \cup \{4\} = A$. This is easy: just remove 4 from $A$. That is, let $B = A \setminus \{4\}$.</p>
        
        <p>What have we shown? Since there are 8 subsets of $X$ which do not contain 4, there are also 8 subsets of $X$ which do, and therefore there are 16 subsets of total (since every subset of $X$ either does, or does not, contain the number 4).</p>
        
        <p>Can you generalize this argument? Let $X$ be any set of size $n$. Let $a \in X$. Find a bijection between those subsets of $X$ which do not contain $a$, and those which do. Then, use the inductive assumption to show that there are $2^n$ subsets of $X$ which do not contain $a$, and $2^n$ which do. Therefore there are $2^n + 2^n = 2^{n+1}$ subsets of $X$ total.</p>

        <h2 id="strong-induction">Strong Induction</h2>
        
        <p>There is another form of induction known as "strong induction": suppose $P(x)$ is a predicate such that $P(0)$ is true and, for each natural number $n$, if for all $k < n$, $P(k)$ is true, then $P(n)$ is also true. Then we can conclude that $\forall x P(x)$ is true.</p>
        
        <p>So the strategy here is similar: prove the base case. Then let $n$ be an arbitrary integer and assume that $\forall k < n(P(k))$ is true. Use that to try to prove $P(n)$. Then you can conclude that $\forall x(P(x))$ is true.</p>
        
        <p>Take a look at Example 2.5.5 from Discrete: An Open Introduction. In this example you prove that every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime or can be written as a product of primes.</p>

        <h2 id="incorrect-proofs">Incorrect Proofs By Induction</h2>
        
        <p>Consider the following argument that all horses are the same color. Let $P(x)$ be the statement that, in any group of size $x$, all the horses in that group are the same color. Notice that $P(0)$ is trivially true (as is $P(1)$).</p>
        
        <p>Let $n$ be any given natural number and assume that $P(n)$ is true: that is, in any group of $n$ horses, all the horses in that group are the same color. We want to show $P(n+1)$, so suppose we have a set $X$ consisting of $n+1$ horses. Exclude the first horse, and we have a set of $n$ horses. Those are all the same color by the inductive hypothesis. Exclude the last horse, and we again have a set of $n$ horses, which are all the same color by the inductive hypothesis. Considering each case, we conclude that the first horse is the same color as the rest of the group, which is the same color as the last horse.</p>
        
        <details class="answer">
            <summary>Where does this argument go wrong?</summary>
            <p>This argument has its own Wikipedia page which goes through, with visual explanations, what goes wrong here. The subtle flaw in the argument is that it doesn't work for the base case when moving from $n=1$ to $n=2$. When $n=1$, both the "first horse" and "last horse" are the same horse, so the argument that the first horse is the same color as the rest of the group (which includes the last horse) doesn't actually prove anything about a second horse.</p>
            
            <p>In the step from $n=1$ to $n=2$, we have two horses. Removing the first horse leaves a set of one horse (all the same color by the base case). Removing the last horse leaves a set of one horse (all the same color by the base case). But there's no overlap between these two sets that would allow us to conclude that both horses are the same color. The argument implicitly assumes that there's at least one horse that's in both of the smaller sets, which requires $n \geq 2$.</p>
        </details>

        <h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
        
        <p>There are lots of good exercises on proof by induction available in Discrete: An Open Introduction. I encourage you to go through as much of these as you can on your own, in addition to the departure pass (coming soon!).</p>

        <h2 id="recursive-definitions">Recursive Definitions</h2>
        
        <p>Often times, induction is used to prove properties about <strong>recursively defined functions</strong>. A simple example of a recursively defined function is factorial:</p>
        
        <div class="math-box">
            $$n! = \begin{cases} 
            1 & \text{if } n = 0 \\ 
            n \times (n - 1)! & \text{if } n > 0 
            \end{cases}$$
        </div>
        
        <p>A recursively defined function has to have a base case (sometimes, more than one base case is given). Above, the base case is when $n = 0$. Then a recursive definition has a part where, in order to compute the value of the function for some $n$, you need to know the values of the function for smaller inputs. (This is exactly the same as the concept of recursion from computer science.)</p>
        
        <p>The binomial coefficients we have seen also can be defined recursively using Pascal's triangle. Recall Pascal's triangle is the pattern formed by starting with 1's on the end, and then adding two consecutive numbers from the row above:</p>
        
        \begin{array}{cccccc}
1 & & & & & \\
1 & 1 & & & & \\
1 & 2 & 1 & & & \\
1 & 3 & 3 & 1 & & \\
1 & 4 & 6 & 4 & 1 & \\
1 & 5 & 10 & 10 & 5 & 1
\end{array}
        
        <p>This definition is given by:</p>
        
        <div class="math-box">
            $$\binom{n}{k} = \begin{cases} 
            1 & \text{if } k = 0 \text{ or } k = n \\ 
            \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} & \text{if } 1 \leq k \leq n - 1 
            \end{cases}$$
        </div>
        
        <p>We can prove that this definition is equivalent to the definition</p>
        
        <div class="math-box">
            $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
        </div>
        
        <p>for all $n$ and $k \leq n$:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>If $k = 0$ or $k = n$, just plug in and verify that both definitions give you $\binom{n}{k} = 1$</li>
            <li>If $1 \leq k \leq n$ then we need to show:
                <div class="math-box">
                    $$\frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} + \frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We can show this using some algebra. First, get a common denominator on the left hand side:</p>
        
        <div class="math-box">
            $$\frac{k}{k}\frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} + \frac{n-k}{n-k}\frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} = \frac{k(n-1)! + (n-k)(n-1)!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
        </div>
        
        <p>Now notice that $k(n-1)! + (n-k)(n-1)! = n(n-1)!$, which is just $n!$. So we simplify and get $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ on both sides.</p>
        
        <p>We did not need to use induction to prove that these definitions are equivalent. But the recursive definition may be more helpful when we want to prove other results by induction. Think about how you might prove the binomial theorem:</p>
        
        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Theorem:</strong> (Binomial Theorem). Let $x$, $y$ be variables and $n \geq 0$. Then:</p>
            <div class="math-box">
                $$(x+y)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^{k}$$
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Think about what a proof by induction for this would look like. First you can let $n = 0$, and realize that $(x+y)^{0}$ is just 1. On the other side, what do you get?</p>
        
        <p>Then for the inductive step, you let $n$ be an arbitrary natural number and assume that $(x+y)^{n} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^{k}$. Then consider $(x+y)^{n+1}$. Think of this as $(x+y)(x+y)^{n}$. Now re-write this as $x(x+y)^{n} + y(x+y)^{n}$ using the distributive property, and then use the inductive hypothesis. Can you finish the proof?</p>

            <p><strong>Corollary:</strong> Let $n \geq 0$. Then: $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^{n}$</p>
            <p><strong>Proof hint:</strong> Plug in $x = 1$ and $y = 1$ to the Binomial Theorem. What do you get?</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can you give a set-theoretic proof of the above identity? Where are the formulas $\binom{n}{k}$ and $2^{n}$ used in set theory?</p>
