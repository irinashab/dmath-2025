<h2 id="problem-solving-continues">Problem solving continues</h2>
<p>We will continue to work through some of the problems in <a href="https://bogart.openmathbooks.org/ctgd/s1-2-basics.html">Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery, Ch 1.2</a></p>
<p><strong>Problem 3</strong> One of the schools sending its team to the tournament has to send its players from some distance, and so it is making sandwiches for team members to eat along the way. There are three choices for the kind of bread and five choices for the kind of filling. How many different kinds of sandwiches are available?<br /></p>

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary> <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 5 = 15\)</span>
</details>
<p><strong>Problem 4</strong> An ordered pair <strong><span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span></strong> consists of two things we call <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. We say <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the first member of the pair and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the second member of the pair. If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is an m-element set and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is an n-element set, how many ordered pairs are there whose first member is in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and whose second member is in <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>?<br /></p>

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary> There are <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> ordered pairs. This is exactly problem 3, where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the set of types of bread, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the set of types of filling.<br />
</details>
<p><strong>Problem 5</strong> Since a sandwich by itself is pretty boring, students from the school in Pronlem 3 are offered a choice of a drink (from among five different kinds), a sandwich, and a fruit (from among four different kinds). In how many ways may a student make a choice of the three items now?<br /></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>5 choices for drinks, 15 choices for sandwiches, and 4 choices for fruits makes <span class="math inline">\(5\times 15\times 4 =300\)</span> choices.<br/>
</details>
<p><strong>Problem 6</strong> The coach of the team in Problem 3 knows of an ice cream parlor along the way where she plans to stop to buy each team member a triple decker cone. There are 12 different flavors of ice cream, and triple decker cones are made in homemade waffle cones. Having chocolate ice cream as the bottom scoop is different from having chocolate ice cream as the top scoop. How many possible ice cream cones are going to be available to the team members? How many cones with three different kinds of ice cream will be available?<br /></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>There are two questions here: first, how many possible ice cream cones are there? This part allows for the choice of chocolate / chocolate / chocolate. Since there are 12 choices for the top scoop, 12 for the second, and then 12 for the third, there are <span class="math inline">\(12^3 = 1728\)</span> possible ice cream cones.<br/> The second question asks: how many cones with three different flavors can be made? Once you've chosen one of the 12 flavors for the bottom scoop, how many choices do you have for the middle scoop? Then how many choices do you have for the top scoop? There are <span class="math inline">\(12 \times11 \times 10=1320\)</span> available cones with three different flavors of ice cream.<br />
</details>
<p><strong>Problem 7: Functions</strong> The idea of a function is ubiquitous in mathematics. A function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to a set <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> means that the inputs to <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> come from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and outputs go to<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The sets <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> represent domain and codomain.We will talk more about these notions. We know of functions from algebra and calculus and in those cases the functions are usually algebraic rules like <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=\frac{\pi}{x}\)</span>. In case of finite sets we just list out the values of the function rather than coming up with some rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write down all the different functions you can from the set <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> to the set <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span>.</p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>
  There are <span class="math inline">\(2^2=4\)</span> functions. Listed as mappings <span class="math inline">\(f:\{1,2\}\to\{a,b\}\)</span>:
  <ul>
    <li><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=a, f(2)=a\)</span> i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\{(1,a),(2,a)\}\)</span></li>
    <li><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=a, f(2)=b\)</span> i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\{(1,a),(2,b)\}\)</span></li>
    <li><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=b, f(2)=a\)</span> i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\{(1,b),(2,a)\}\)</span></li>
    <li><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=b, f(2)=b\)</span> i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\{(1,b),(2,b)\}\)</span></li>

<li><p>How many functions are there from the three element set <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3\}\)</span> to the set <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span>?</p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>
  Let’s think about this like in Problem 6. Pretend the set <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> refers to two different choices of ice cream flavors, and <span class="math inline">\(f(1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(2)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f(3)\)</span> refer to the flavor choice picked for each scoop (top, middle, and bottom respectively). There are two choices for each scoop, so we have <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\)</span> functions total. See if you can write these down! (<strong>Note:</strong> Does this remind you of anything? How many rows in a truth table are there for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables, if each variable can only be assigned T or F?)
</details>
</li>
<li><p>How many functions are there from the two element set <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> to the three element set <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3\}\)</span>?</p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>
  There are three choices for <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> and three for <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\)</span>, so there are <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> different functions total.
</details>
</li>
<li><p>How many functions are there from a three element set to a 12 element set?</p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>
  We’ve done this.
</details>
</li>
<li><p>The function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is called <strong>one-to-one</strong> or an <strong>injection</strong> if whenever <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is different from <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is different from <span class="math inline">\(f(y)\)</span>. How many one-to-one functions are there from a three element set to a 12 element set?</p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>
  We’ve done this also! The "one to one" part is akin to saying, in problem 6, that we are not counting cones with two or more scoops of chocolate. Only cones with three different flavors are counted.
</details>
</li>
<li><p>Explain the relationship between this problem and Problem 6.<br />
Try to summarize how the "function" and set-theoretic vocabulary generalizes the two questions in Problem 6.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem 8a</strong> A group of hungry team members in notices it would be cheaper to buy three pints of ice cream for them to split than to buy a triple decker cone for each of them, and that way they would get more ice cream. They ask their coach if they can buy three pints of ice cream. In how many ways can they choose three pints of different flavors out of the 12 flavors?<br />
This is similar to the second part of question 6, but not quite the same: in that question, ordering an ice cream with chocolate-vanilla-strawberry scoops was different from an ice cream with strawberry-vanilla-chocolate. In this problem, buying a pint of chocolate, a pint of vanilla, and a pint of strawberry is the same as buying those three flavors in any order.</p>
<p>Let's think about this for a smaller number of flavors first, and then you can try out the larger case on your own. Let's say we have 5 flavors to choose from, and we want to buy 3 different pints of ice cream. The first thing we can do is ask, similar to question 6, if we did care about the order in which we bought the flavors, how many ways can we list out those three flavors? There are 5 choices for the first flavor, 4 choices for the second, and 3 for the third, so there are 60 ways to list out 3 flavors.</p>
<p>Now recognize that many of those choices are redundant: how many of those 60 listings of 3 flavors contain chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry? Another way of asking this question is: in how many ways can I list out chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry in some order? Out of these 3 flavors, I have 3 choices for the first, 2 for the second, and 1 for the third, and so there are 6 ways to list out 3 flavors.</p>
<p>For any group of 3 flavors, there are 6 arrangements of those 3 flavors. So that means, out of those 60 ways of listing out 3 flavors, each group of 3 ends up getting repeated 6 times. That tells us that there are 10 (or <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{60}{6}\)</span>) unique groups of 3 that we can make out of 5 flavors.</p>
<p>Now do the same logic for this problem with 12 flavors and see if you can determine the correct number of groups of 3 flavors out of a possible 12.<br />
<details>
  <summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>
  There are <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{12 \times 11 \times 10}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 144\)</span> ways we can choose 3 pints of different flavors out of the 12 flavors.
</details>
<h2 id="big-ideas">Big ideas</h2>
<p>The problems we worked through help motivate a number of the counting concepts / rules we will deal with. The first is the multiplicative property: if we make two choices, with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> possible first choices, and, for each way of making that first choice, there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> possible second choices, then there are <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span> ways in which we can make the two choices.<br />
Examples:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problem 3: There are 3 choices for the kind of bread, and 5 choices for the kind of filling.</p></li>
<li><p>Problem 5: This is a generalization of the multiplicative property, where we make three choices instead of two. But the principle is the same.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> How many arrangements of the letters "ABCD" are there?<br />
<strong>Hint:</strong> An arrangement consists of choosing a first letter, then choosing a second one (that is different from the first), a third letter (different from the first two), and finally a fourth letter (different from the first three).</p>
<h2 id="permutations">Permutations</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Given a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects <span class="math inline">\(a_1, \ldots, a_n\)</span>, a permutation of those objects is an arrangement of the objects in some order. A <em><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation</em> is an arrangement of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of those objects in some order.<br />
For example, BACD is a permutation of the letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D', while BAD is a 3-permutation of those letters. Notice that a 4-permutation of those letters is just a permutation. In general, an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-permutation of a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects is just a permutation.</p>
<h2 id="factorials">Factorials</h2>
<p>If you have heard of factorials before, you likely have guessed that this concept would show up at some point in this lesson. The example last time: "How many arrangements of the letters C A T are there?" highlighted this concept. There are three letters and <span class="math inline">\(3!=6\)</span> arrangements of the letters.<br />
Usually, <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span>, read "n factorial" is defined recursively as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n! = \begin{cases}
    1 &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
    n \times (n-1)! &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 0
\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>For example, <span class="math inline">\(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\)</span><br />
Let's flip the script, however. Instead of defining factorials this way as some arbitrary numerical operation, we define factorials combinatorially:<br />
<strong>Definition:</strong> For a natural number <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span>, the <em>factorial of</em> <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, written <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span>, is equal to the number of arrangements of a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects.<br />
Later on we will prove the equivalence of these definitions: that is, for any <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span>, the number of arrangements of a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects is equal to the previously given recursive formula. (This is strange in the case of <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span>, as it's not clear what an arrangement of 0 objects is, but we will have to define things precisely first to make sense of it.)</p>
<h2 id="generalization-functions">Generalization: Functions</h2>
<p>Much of the discussion about permutations and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations can be discussed in the language of functions. I will assume that we know what a function is for now (later on, we will consider a more rigorous, set-theoretic definition of the term).<br />
<strong>Notation:</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are sets, then the notation "<span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span>" means "f is a function with domain <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and codomain <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>". Recall: the domain of a function is the set of possible inputs to that function, and the codomain of a function is the set of possible outputs for that function.<br />
<strong>Definition:</strong> A function "<span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span>" <em>is one to one</em>, or <em>injective</em>, if whenever <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span> are different objects in the domain (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>), then <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \neq f(y)\)</span> are different objects in the codomain.<br />
This definition was given in Problem 7. In that problem, one was supposed to see that there is a correspondence between one to one functions and arrangements (or "<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations", as I defined them).<br />
<strong>Question:</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f : \{ 1, 2, \ldots, k \} \to \{ A, B, C, D \}\)</span> is a one to one function. In what sense does <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> correspond to a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation of the letters A, B, C, and D?<br />
There are several good arguments one could give for this question. My hint would be to think about how we write down an actual <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>, we need to write down 2 different letters. We pick a letter from A, B, C, or D, and then we pick a different one. I think of it as literally writing down two blanks, and numbering the blanks as and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Now think about what <span class="math inline">\(f(1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(2)\)</span> are.<br />
<strong>Question:</strong> How many 3-permutations are there of a collection of 10 distinct objects?<br />
In a similar vein to the above: write down three blanks, and now think about the number of choices for the first, second, and third blank.<br />
<strong>Question:</strong> How many 4-permutations are there of a collection of 10 distinct objects?<br />
<strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a positive integer less than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Then the number of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations of a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects is equal to <span class="math display">\[\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Show that your answers to the previous questions match up with this theorem.<br />
This theorem is a generalization of the results we had been talking about in this section. But this is not necessarily the right way to think about counting <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations: the simplest way is to just write down <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> blanks and count the number of choices for each blank.</p>
<h2 id="justification">Justification</h2>
<p>We stated the theorem without proving it. It's worth thinking through the proof in terms of what these symbols mean.<br />
As we know: <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> counts the number of permutations of objects. Let's give an example: suppose our objects are the letters A, B, C, D, E. Then there are 120 (or <span class="math inline">\(5!\)</span>) permutations of those letters. If I wanted to list all of the 2-permutations of those letters, I could start by listing out all 120 permutations. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ABCDE</p></li>
<li><p>ABCED</p></li>
<li><p>ABDCE</p></li>
<li><p>ABDEC</p></li>
<li><p>ABECD</p></li>
<li><p>ABEDC</p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After I have listed out all the permutations, I could delete the last three letters of each to get a 2-permutation. But of course, we end up with many repetitions: ABCDE, ABCED, ABDCE, ABDEC, ABECD, and ABEDC all give us the same 2-permutation: AB.<br />
In fact, every 2-permutation will be repeated exactly 6 times! Why is that? Because re-arranging the last three letters does not change the 2-permutation! Why 6, though? Because there are exactly 6, or <span class="math inline">\(3!\)</span>, permutations of the last three objects.<br />
So, out of those 120 permutations, we actually get 20 distinct 2-permutations, each of which repeats 6 times.</p>
<p>This argument is quite subtle and so it is worth thinking about more carefully. But the argument given does generalize. If we list out all the permutations of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> objects, and delete the last <span class="math inline">\(n-k\)</span> letters, each <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation will repeat exactly <span class="math inline">\((n-k)!\)</span> times, because rearranging those last <span class="math inline">\(n-k\)</span> letters does not change the resulting <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation.</p>
<h2 id="combinations">Combinations</h2>
<p>In Problem 8(a), we counted the number of groups of 3 different flavors we can make out of 12 flavors in total. Let's rephrase how we studied this problem. We first found the number of <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-permutations we could make from a collection of 12 distinct objects, and then we saw that each group of 3 flavors that we listed out was repeated several times: in fact, it was repeated <span class="math inline">\(3!\)</span> times, since there are <span class="math inline">\(3!\)</span> arrangements of three flavors.<br />
So we can generalize this. If we have a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> objects and we want to count the ways we can make a group of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of them, we first can count the number of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations of those objects using the formula we found before. Then we divide that by the number of arrangements of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> objects; that is, we divide it by <span class="math inline">\(k!\)</span>. We will refer to the number of groups of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that we can make out of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> objects as <span class="math inline">\(\binom{n}{k}\)</span>, which we read as "<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> choose <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>". The argument we have just given gives us a formula for this:<span class="math display">\[\binom{n}{k} = \dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\binom{n}{k} = \dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\)</span> is sometimes referred to as the "binomial coefficient" because these show up as coefficients when you look at <span class="math inline">\((x + y)^n\)</span>. Recall that <span class="math inline">\(x+y\)</span> is a <strong>binomial</strong>, a sum of two terms in an algebraic expression.</p>
