        <h1 id="warm-up">Warm-Up</h1>

<p>We start with a game for two players. The game works as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Players take turns choosing integers from 1 - 9 (inclusive).</li>
  <li>Once a number is chosen, the other player cannot choose it.</li>
  <li>A player wins if they choose three numbers that add up to 15.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1: 8</li>
  <li>P2: 5</li>
  <li>P1: 2</li>
  <li>P2: 6</li>
  <li>P1: 4 (does not win yet, since $8 + 2 + 4 = 14$)</li>
  <li>P2: 9 (does not win, because $9 + 6 + 5 = 20$)</li>
  <li>P1: 3 (<strong>wins</strong>: $8 + 4 + 3 = 15$)</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that player 1 does not use all four numbers that they pick: they can only use three numbers out of the ones they pick. It’s possible for the game to end in a tie.</p>

<p>Pair up!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce yourself: name, pronouns, year, major, interests, etc.</li>
  <li>Play the game. Try playing it a few times, with each person playing as player 1 sometimes and player 2 at other times.</li>
  <li>After playing the game for a few minutes, see if you can come up with a strategy.</li>
  <li>Does this game and/or its strategy remind you of any other games you have played in your life?</li>
  <li>Then try to play against another group.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mathematical-writing">Mathematical writing</h1>
        <p>Before we even cover any actual topics in discrete mathematics, we need to cover a more fundamental topic: writing. We communicate mathematics by writing, and so it is important that we understand how to write well.</p>

<p>What is the problem with the following “proof”?</p>
\[ x^2 + (x + 2)^2 = 100 \]

\[ x^2 + x^2 + 4x + 4 = 100 \]

\[ 2x^2 + 4x + 4 = 100 \]

\[ 2x^2 + 4x - 96 = 0 \]

\[ x^2 + 2x - 48 = 0 \]

\[ (x + 8)(x - 6) = 0 \]

\[ x = -8, 6 \]

\[ x > 0 \implies x = 6 \]
<p>This "proof" is an example of bad mathematical writing because it fails to state the problem it is solving. 
It begins directly with an equation without providing any context, such as what \(x\) represents or what the equation models.How is one supposed to read this? Are these conditional (“if-then”) statements? Are they “and” statements? It’s not clear how each statement connects to the next.
For instance, this equation might be part of a problem to find two consecutive even integers whose squares sum to 100, 
but without stating that, the proof is unclear and meaningless to the reader. Additionally, the proof assumes the reader knows why
\(x > 0\) is relevant, and it does not define any variables or assumptions. Good mathematical writing should always clearly state the problem,
    define all variables, and provide necessary context before proceeding with calculations.
</p>
<p>Now consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>:</p>
<p>Find two positive numbers that differ by 2 and whose squares sum to 100.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p>
<p> Let the smaller number be \(x\). Since the numbers differ by 2, the larger number is \(x + 2\).<br/>
The condition that the sum of their squares is 100 gives us the following equation:
\[
x^2 + (x + 2)^2 = 100
\]
We now solve for \(x\):
<ol>
<li>Expand the squared term:
    \[
    x^2 + (x^2 + 4x + 4) = 100
    \]</li>
<li>Combine like terms:
    \[
    2x^2 + 4x + 4 = 100
    \]</li>
<li>Subtract 100 from both sides to set the equation to zero:
    \[
    2x^2 + 4x - 96 = 0
    \]</li>
<li> Simplify by dividing the entire equation by 2:
    \[
    x^2 + 2x - 48 = 0
    \]</li>
<li> Factor the quadratic equation:
    \[
    (x + 8)(x - 6) = 0
    \]</li>
<li> Apply the zero-product property:
    \[
    x = -8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 6
    \]</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
We are asked to find <em>positive</em> numbers. Therefore, we discard the negative solution \(x = -8\).
</p>
<p>The smaller number is \(x = 6\). The larger number is \(x + 2 = 8\).
</p>
<p><strong>Verification (Sanity Check)</strong>: \(6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100\)</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong>: The two numbers are \(6\) and \(8\)</p>
<p>You can read more about mathematical writing in <a href="https://math.hmc.edu/su/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/good-math-writing.pdf" target=_blank>GUIDELINES FOR GOOD MATHEMATICAL WRITING</a> by Francis Su</p>
<h1 id="latex-markup">LaTeX Markup</h1>

<p>Have you ever wondered how mathematical articles are typed? We do not have symbols on the keyboard for things like exponents, so \(x^2\) might not be so easy to write. \(\pi\) will certainly not appear on your keyboard, either, and good luck finding the symbol for \(\int\).</p>

<p>The answer is called <strong>LaTeX</strong>. LaTeX is a markup language used to typeset academic articles. Academic articles are <strong>not</strong> written in Microsoft Word or Google Docs: while you <em>can</em> get them to understand mathematical equations, it is not standard and somewhat clunky. LaTeX is <strong>the</strong> standard. These course notes are a minor exception: in addition to LaTeX for the mathematical symbols, I am also using GitHub Pages to write HTML and MathJax (a Javascript library that renders LaTeX on the web).</p>

<h2 class="no_toc" id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>

<p>There are several ways to set up and install LaTeX. If you prefer not to install anything on your local computer, you can create a <strong>free</strong> account on <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf.com</a>. This is the simplest way to get up and running.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use LaTeX on your own computer, you will need two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A LaTeX <em>distribution</em>: either <a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/" target=_blank>MacTex</a>, on Mac OS X, or <a href="https://miktex.org/about" target=_blank>MikTex</a> for Windows.</li>
  <li>A LaTeX <em>editor</em>: my preference is <a href="https://www.texstudio.org" target=_blank>texstudio</a>. MikTex and MacTex both come with LaTeX editors, and so you can use those if you like (MikTex comes with TeXworks, MacTex comes with TeXShop), though I prefer TeXstudio.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have written your document in LaTeX, saved as a .tex file, you will be able to compile it to a PDF.</p>

<h2 class="no_toc" id="basic-formatting">Basic Formatting</h2>

<p>A simple LaTeX file may look something like:</p>

<div class="math-box"><div class="language-latex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">\documentclass</span><span class="p">{</span>article<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">% This is a comment</span>
<span class="c">% This part of the file is called the preamble.</span>
<span class="c">% Title / author / date can go here</span>
<span class="c">% Can also include packages that we need to use to render the math correctly</span>
<span class="k">\title</span><span class="p">{</span>This is my title<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">\author</span><span class="p">{</span>My Name<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">\begin{document}</span>

<span class="c">% This is the main body of the document.</span>
<span class="k">\maketitle</span>

Paragraph 1.

Paragraph 2.

<span class="nt">\end{document}</span>
</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>It can be overwhelming to start a LaTeX document from scratch, so feel free to use the homework files I post to start. I include several packages, macros and definitions in my preamble.</p>

<h2 class="no_toc" id="formatting-math">Formatting Math</h2>

<p>To format math in a LaTeX file, you use dollar signs to start and end your mathematical notations. Technically this is referred to as “in-line” math mode: for example, to write the sentence “If  \(a \neq 0\), then \(ax^2 + bx + c\) is a quadratic polynomial”, you use the following LaTeX syntax:</p>

<div class="math-box"><div class="language-latex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>If <span class="p">$</span><span class="nb">a </span><span class="nv">\neq</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">$</span>, then <span class="p">$</span><span class="nb">ax</span><span class="p">^</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nb"> bx </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nb"> c</span><span class="p">$</span> is a quadratic polynomial.
</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>This is “in-line”, since the math is formatted in the middle of the sentence. There is also “displayed” math mode: you can use two dollar signs ($$) to start and end, and that will display the mathematical content on its own line.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are certain commands we use to put in mathematical notation. For exponents / superscripts we use the carat (^), for “not equals” ($\neq) we use “\neq”. There are many good guides to finding basic LaTeX commands for mathematical notation, you can find them below.</p>
